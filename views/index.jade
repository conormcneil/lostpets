      p Losing a pet can be stressful and deeply saddening. Many of us have lost a beloved pet and can remember the pain and sense of hopelessness that quickly sets in. While a visual search of the neighborhood has been the most effective method for finding a lost pet, not everyone manages to find their lost family member.
      br
      p For those pets that become lost for an extended period, Finding Fido provides a centralized location for people to enlist the support of their communities in finding their pets and safely returning them home.
