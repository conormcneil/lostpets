Our team is creating a website which allows pet-owners to search a database for pets they have lost. Additionally, persons who find pets can update the database with a photograph, description, and location for the animals they find. As pet-owners and people who are sympathetic to pet-owners who lose pets,  we want to increase the rate at which pet-owners recover their lost pets.

We are using HTML, CSS, and jQuery to build the front end website where users can view lost and found pets. We are using PSQL, KNEX, and NPM to build the back-end where the actual data on the pet-owners and lost pets is stored.
